# Sclerosis Detection using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect types of sclerosis from MRI images. The application is built with a custom Tkinter GUI for ease of use and integrates a trained deep learning model for image classification.

## üß† Features

- User-friendly desktop application built with CustomTkinter
- Upload MRI images for prediction
- Trained CNN model for sclerosis classification
- SQLite database integration for hospital record keeping
- Separate modules for prediction, reporting, and UI
